Imported MessageKit Library for supported iOS 11 & 12 
https://github.com/MessageKit/MessageKit

MessageKit imported version 3.7.0 (SPM, Compatible Xcode 13, Swift 5.5)

I Create a folder called "FILED MODIFIED". It contains files modified from this library.
MessageKit has also an dependence library called InputBarAccessoryView. Same folder created.

For those files, I only add if #available(iOS 11.0, *) condition
